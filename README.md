# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire — Repository README

> This repository contains an implementation of a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" style quiz game designed for web deployment. The project is intended for educational use, prototyping game mechanics, and learning about state management, audio/animation coordination, and accessibility considerations.

## Project description

This project implements the core gameplay loop of the classic quiz show: progressive money milestones, four answer options per question, lifelines (50:50, Phone a Friend, Ask the Audience), timers, sound and animation coordination, and result screens. The implementation emphasizes modular code, testability, and clear separation between UI and game logic to facilitate reuse in teaching and research contexts.

## Key features

- Progressive question sequence with configurable milestones
- Four-option multiple choice questions with correct/incorrect handling
- Lifelines: 50:50, Phone a Friend (simulated), Ask the Audience (simulated poll)
- Per-question timer with configurable duration and pause/resume behavior
- Audio cues and animations coordinated with game events
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation support and semantic HTML
- Modular architecture to allow swapping question backends (local JSON, REST API)

## Technology stack

- Frontend: React (Vite or Create React App compatible), React Router
- State management: React context and hooks (optionally Redux)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (recommended) or CSS modules
- Build tools: Node.js, npm or yarn
- Optional: TypeScript for type safety

## Installation

1. Ensure Node.js (16+) and npm (8+) or yarn are installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

## Development

- Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# npm start
```

- Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

- Run tests (if present)

```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration

- `src/config/questions.json` or an API endpoint may be used as the question source.
- Runtime options (timer length, lifeline availability, difficulty distribution) are exposed via a `config` module to support experiments and A/B testing.

## File structure (suggested)

```
└───src
    ├───api
    ├───assets
    │   ├───images
    │   └───sounds
    ├───components
    ├───data
    └───pages
```

## Accessibility and internationalization

- Use semantic HTML elements for interactive controls.
- Provide keyboard focus states and ARIA labels for lifelines and timer controls.
- Keep text strings in a single `i18n` resource file to allow localization.

## Testing and quality

- Unit tests for game logic (milestone progression, lifeline resolution, scoring).
- Integration tests for important UI flows (answering, lifeline use, timer expiry).
- Automated linting and formatting via ESLint and Prettier.

## Contribution guidelines

1. Open an issue to discuss substantial changes before implementing them.
2. Create a feature branch named `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
3. Keep commits atomic and provide descriptive messages.
4. Submit a pull request referencing the issue and include screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
